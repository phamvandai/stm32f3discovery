# STM32F3 Discovery FatFS with SPI SD Card

In this example, we will use SPI SD Card with FatFS.

This board does not have SDIO interface, we will use SD card with SPI2.

Those SD SPI & FatFS code are borrowed from NUCLEO-L4R5ZI Demonstration (Adafruit LCD & SD Joystick)
with some error fixed from https://community.st.com/thread/47177-bug-in-stm32adafruitsdc-spi-sd-card

To configure & customize SPI, please read fatfs/drivers/stm32f3_disco_sdspi_io.h.

To use SPI polling transfer, set SD_READWRITE_POLLING = 1  

To use SPI interrupt transfer, set SD_READWRITE_POLLING = 0 and SD_READWRITE_DMA = 0

To use SPI DMA transfer, set SD_READWRITE_POLLING = 0 and SD_READWRITE_DMA = 1 

# Current configuration:

	+ SD Card with SPI2
	+ SCK Pin: PF9
	+ MISO Pin: PB14
	+ MOSI Pin: PB15
	+ SD CS Pin: PB13
	
Note: Don't use SPI2 data & init code generated by CubeMX, we will init it in  SD Driver.
